    You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind.
    Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the
    avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
    turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and
    only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said
    we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
    lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

    Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped
    to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with
    a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
    that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a
    toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here
    shopping for an infant named Jeb.

    Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all
    makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's
    going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're
    friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why,
    David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.
